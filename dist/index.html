    <p>The campus we know today is vastly <a href="http://www.dailycal.org/2018/03/25/uc-berkeley-campus-history-evolution-dwinelle-wheeler-kerr/">different</a> from its humble beginnings. In 1873, the campus comprised only two buildings — North and South halls — one of which still stands today. Other buildings were not as lucky. </p>
<p>Scroll down to find our map detailing buildings and landmarks through the decades as they grew to become the campus we walk through every day. Pay special attention to when iconic structures such as the Campanile and Sather Gate were erected, and see how old some of the classrooms you’re sitting in are. </p>
<p><i> Note: This map is not a comprehensive projection of every building to exist on campus — some have been left out for clarity. </i></p>
